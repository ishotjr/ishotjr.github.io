This site is intended as a guided tour of some of my projects/GitHub repos, while at the same time serving as an excuse to become more familiar with Jekyll, and hopefully, as a further byproduct, result in a template site that can be used for other projects' `gh-pages`.  [Read More...](about)

## Projects

### [pw-dos](https://github.com/ishotjr/pw-dos)

pw-dos is a silly [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) watchface that I created as an exercise around with the premise of brushing up on the [3.0 SDK](http://developer.getpebble.com/sdk/); somehow it accidentally gained over 1,000 users in the few months since it reared its preposterous head, so development has continued by popular demand, and has already spawned several variants!

### [flipflop](https://github.com/FlipFlopHome/flipflop)

flipflop is an attempt at realizing fellow [HackDad](https://github.com/HackDads) (in exile?) [@juliendarrah](https://github.com/juliendarrah)'s dream of home automation (especially in the area of pool maintenance), currently targeting the [ESP8266](https://github.com/FlipFlopHome/flipflop/wiki/ESP8266-Firmware-Loader---Using-NodeMCU-Firmware-Programmer) and [Kinetis K10](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/taxonomy.jsp?code=K10_BASELINE_MCU&cof=0&am=0).

### [pro-pebble-dev](https://github.com/ishotjr/pro-pebble-dev)

Pro Pebble Development is an attempt at chronicling my ongoing adventures with the Pebble SDK 3.0 and related technologies. My goal is to apply "professional" software development practices to what started out as "hobby" code, and share techniques, resources, and challenges along the way.  It's also another opportunity to play with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)!

### [The Rest...](https://github.com/ishotjr?tab=repositories)

More of my projects and others' that I've borrowed and/or contributed to can of course be found in the usual location - will do my best to highlight them here or in upcoming blog posts soon... ! <img class="emoji" title=":bowtie:" alt=":bowtie:" src="https://assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/sweat_smile.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">
