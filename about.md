This site is intended as a guided tour of some of my projects/GitHub repos, while at the same time serving as an excuse to become more familiar with Jekyll, and hopefully, as a further byproduct, result in a template site that can be used for other projects' `gh-pages`.  It is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and based loosely on the [Bootstrap Blog template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/).  If you would need a lightweight, responsive, Bootstrap-y site that be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/), then you are welcome to [grab a copy](https://github.com/ishotjr/ishotjr.github.io/releases/tag/jekyll-template) (without all my posts and pages) for yourself - or just [view the source](https://github.com/ishotjr/ishotjr.github.io).
